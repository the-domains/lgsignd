# **Scandinavian Christmas Elf Nisse dolls...**

### ...are a holiday tradition in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.

**A Tomte** (usually Swedish)**, a Nisse** (usually Norwegian and Danish), **a Tonttu **(usually Finnish) are similar characters. They are an important symbol for the Christmas celebration.

**A Tomte, Nisse** or**Tonttu** is a humanoid mythical creature and also one of the most familiar creatures of Scandinavian folklore.**The Tomte** or **Nisse** was believed to take care of a farmerÂ´s home and children and protect them from misfortune, in particular at night, when the housefolk were asleep.

**"Jultomten" **(also known simply as Tomte) is Swedens Father Christmas, visiting houses in the afternoon on Christmas Eve to distribute presents to children. In Sweden, Christmas gifts are brought by the**Jultomten** (JUL = Christmas).

The Danish **"Julenisse" **does not distribute gifts. Instead, he lurks about the dark corners of the house, perhaps assuring himself that the family cares properly for the homestead. In modern Denmark, Nisses are often seen as beardless, wearing gray and red woolens with a red cap. A Nisse is kinda like a garden Gnome in America. The Norwegian "Julenisse" does bring gifts too.
